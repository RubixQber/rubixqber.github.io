<p>Hi! I'm a secretory vesicle from an animal cell, although our kind show up in pretty much everywhere!
  Animals and plants and eukaryotic cells all depend on us to survive. Most prokaryotic cells don't have us though.
  I guess they're just missing out. You can usually find me disposing of waste that could potentially harm the cell.
  It's not the most glorious job, but someone has to do it, right? I see myself as someone who provides a critical service
  that nobody else wants to do. </p>
